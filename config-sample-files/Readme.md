# Sample Kubernetes Configuration Files

Each file defines a single kind of object in Kubernetes, and together they form a complete, working “echo” application:

- Namespace: isolation

- ConfigMap/Secret: configuration & credentials

- PV/PVC: durable storage

- Deployment: app definition & scale

- Service: internal networking

- Ingress: external traffic routing
